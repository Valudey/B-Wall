															<h3><a href="blog/31december.html">Happy New Year</a></h3>
																
																<p>Just a quick update before we go into 2012. It's been a bit of a day. I was taken to Battersea Power Station where I met Irene Adler. She's still alive. Dead or alive, it's all just a game to her...

																<p>So there I am, dealing with a mysterious death in the middle of the countryside when suddenly I'm whisked away in a helicopter and taken to Buckingham Palace. Sherlock was already there. Naked except for a sheet wrapped around him...

Someone had broken into their offices and sprayed graffiti across a painting. Nothing too interesting about that, you might think. Except that whoever did it, they didn't show up on any CCTV...
