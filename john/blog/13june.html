        <h3>
         The Solitary Cyclist
        </h3>
        <p>
        Sherlock is a very busy man. It is safe to say that there are hundreds of cases, 
        some of them of the most intricate and extraordinary character, in which he usually 
        plays a prominent part.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Holmes was immersed in a very abstruse and complicated problem when Miss Smith came 
        to Baker Street to see him. His experiment was concerning the peculiar persecution 
        to which John Vincent Harden, the well-known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. 
        Sherlock, who loves above all things precision and concentration of thought, resented 
        anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand. At least, that was 
        my opinion. And yet he finally accepted to listen to her story. It was vain to refuse 
        because the young lady had come with the determination to tell her story, and it 
        was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until she had 
        done so. Sherlock proposed her to take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling her.
        </p>
        <p>
        "Well, it can't be your health, so ardent a cyclist must be full of energy." he said.
        </p>
        <p>
        Miss Smith was quite surprised by his deduction and admitted she bicycle a good deal 
        and that had something to do with her visit. Sherlock was observing her, all the details, as usual. 
        Suddenly he asked her if she was pianist. The woman nodded, telling us she gives piano lessons 
        in Farnham, on the borders of Surrey.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Then, she explained to us what happened to her. 
        Her father is dead. He was James Smith, who conducted the Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra. 
        Her mother and she were left without a relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph 
        Smith, who went to China twenty-five years ago, and they have never had a word 
        from him since. When the father died they were left very poor, they moved up to London. 
        But one day they were told that there was an advertisement in the Times inquiring 
        for our whereabouts. When it happens it is usually because someone had left you a 
        fortune. Then, they went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper. 
        There they met two men, Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, who were home on a visit 
        from China. They said that her uncle was a friend of theirs, that he died 
        some months before in great poverty in Hong-Kong, and that he had asked them with 
        his last breath to hunt up his relations and see that they were in no want. Mr. 
        Carruthers proposed her a job to the conservatory of Farnham, he has relations. 
        She accepted even if she had to leave her mother. Each day, Miss Smith makes the 
        two-mile, between her house and her work, by bicycle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Miss Smith, who is engaged to an electrical engineer named Cyril Morton, described 
        to us Woodley as an 'odious' red-moustached man who leers at her, while the older 
        Carruthers is polite and respectful. One day, Woodley visited her at the conservatory, 
        harassing her and bragging about his wealth. When Carruthers heard the news, 
        he said he was sorry and promised her that she would never see him again. She thinks 
        Carruthers is in love with her. But she didn't come because of Woodley or Carruthers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The problem is that a dark-bearded cyclist began regularly following her to and from work, 
        then disappearing. Her commute is along a country road. She tried to confront her stalker, but he vanished. 
        Sherlock deduced that the bearded man went to the nearby Bourne Woods. 
        He decided to send me to spy on Miss Smith and her stalker while they're in transit, 
        but I didn't observe much other the usual scenario and another of Smith's failed 
        attempts to confront the man. He does learn that everyday an elderly man named Williamson was passing by Bourne Woods.
        Sherlock did his own investigation at a nearby pub, where he learnt Williamson is 
        a defrocked (fired) clergyman with a bad reputation who was friend with Woodley. 
        Woodley had heard the whole conversation. Who was Sherlock? What did he want? What 
        did he mean by asking questions? Sherlock told me he had a fine flow of language, 
        and his adjectives were very vigorous. That's sarcastic of course. In fact, he ended 
        a string of abuse by a "vicious back-hander" which he failed to entirely avoid. It 
        was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. Sherlock left the pub as I see him now. 
        Mr. Woodley, on the other hand, went home on a stretcher. 
        </p>
        <p>
		"So ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that, however enjoyable, my 
		day on the Surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own." he said to me.
		</p>
		<p>
		The next days, Miss Smith wrote to us saying she was quitting her job, not only 
		because of Carruthers, but because Woodley was still hanging around Farnham. She was 
		understandably creeped out and told Carruthers, who lent his car for her protection. 
		When Sherlock and I went to ensure her safety during her last commute, we have 
		intercepted her empty car. Taking the car, we met the bearded cyclist. That was 
		Carruthers from the beginning, also trying to watch and protect the young woman. 
		The three dash to Bourne Woods, where the bound and gagged Smith has just been 
		forcibly 'married' to Woodley by Williamson outside. Enraged, Carruthers shot Woodley, 
		but not fatally. Soon it was revealed that Ralph Smith, in fact, had a fortune that 
		Carruthers and Woodley conspired to get portions of by marrying Miss Smith, its heiress.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        That marriage is legally invalid, since Williamson has been defrocked. He and 
        Woodley were imprisoned for long sentences for abduction and assault while 
        Carruthers gets a lighter sentence. The newly rich Miss Smith married Cyril, 
        who's now senior partner at his company of electricians.
