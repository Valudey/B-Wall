        <h3>
         Dusty Death
        </h3>
        <p>
        I won't name the client out of respect but she came to us because of her late husband. 
        His body was recovered from the sea near Falmouth on the south coast of Cornwall. 
        Mrs. ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ came to Baker Street quite desperate. She showed us some photography 
        of her late husband while talking about him in good ways. He was in his 40's. Sherlock 
        remained silence during the monologue of the mourning woman. 
        </p>
        <p>
        "He drowned, Mr. Holmes. That's what we thought. But when they opened up his lungs... sand." said she.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Of course it was completely superficial to Sherlock. He asked me if it could be 
        caused by a disease. In fact, it could have been the Silicosis. But the problem is 
        it's caused by breathing in tiny bits of silica, a mineral that is part of sand, 
        rock, and mineral ores such as quartz. I personally asked the woman if her husband 
        had difficulties to breath, lung scarring and cough, weight loss, and fatigue. 
        She answered he didn't seem so. 
		</p>
		<p>
		She explained, after having an argument with her (which she regrets), her husband 
		left the house and took out his boat at sea by night. He was discovered on the beach 
		the next morning, incredibly dry, eaten by fishes. His wife went to the morgue, the 
		same day, in order to identify the body. The boat, meanwhile, was found intact by 
		the friends of the deceased, left the same morning to fishing. Nothing was stolen. 
		The lifeboat was still there.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Sherlock and I had gone to the Cornwall coast to solve this mystery. Personally, 
		I saw this little stay in the country as an opportunity to rest a little bit and 
		move away from the London crowd. That wasn't of course Sherlock's opinion. 
		We started with a visit to the morgue to diagnose the husband's death. As Mrs. ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ 
		said, there was actual sand in his lungs. No black  marks on the lungs was visible. 
		So it couldn't have ben the Silicosis. Sherlock declared he had spent most of his 
		time in the water, his body floating on his stomach. He showed me the rips in the 
		skin nibbled by the fishes. The dead husband had spent about 7 hours in the water 
		judging from the bruising and maceration of the skin due to the swell. We then 
		continued our investigation on the beach where the body was found. The night of 
		his disappearance, a strong storm raged on the coast. Sherlock deduced the weather 
		had allowed the body to return to the shore. We also went to inspect the boat. 
		No wrestling or blood marks were found. The sea would have washed the blood. 
		The power of the storm could nevertheless be seen: dried salt water was reflected 
		on the deck with the rays of the sun.
		</p>
		<br>
        <p>
        We spent the rest of the day questioning the locals. The more we questioned people, 
        the more we knew about the deceased's entourage. A lot of people apparently know 
        Mr ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ was violent to his wife. There is an old legend in Carnwall that every time 
        an individual beats his partner, a few grains of sands appear in his lungs. But that's 
        just a legend, is not it? Everyone in Carnwall knows that legend. We discovered that one of the 
        fishermen who found the boat was in love with Mrs. ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓. He went to see her 
        the day of the disappearance. He accused her of refusing the truth, of denying his 
        love for him. He said he would do anything for her, even protect her form her 
        violent husband. Some people told us his story. His ex wife is a veterinarian and 
        they have been separated for three years now. Sherlock has guessed the end of the story. By jalousy, he hid 
        himself on the boat waiting for Mrs. ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓'s husband. The other fisherman was 
        his accomplice. He was on his boat waiting for the signal from the other one to come 
        and get him back. We confronted the fisherman before delivering him to the police 
        him and his accomplice. He admitted to us that he did not want to kill him, just 
        wanted to threaten him and potentially hurt him. He knocked him out and injected 
        sand into his lungs. Sherlock said that despite the difficulty of the operation, 
        it was quite normal that he had managed to introduce the sand because of his 
        veterinary assistant past. The fisherman did not deny the facts. I explained to 
        him that as a doctor I knew that no matter how much sand was injected, the particles 
        in the lungs are lethal and the speed of death is proportional to the dosage. The 
        fisherman explained that at the time of leaving Mr. ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ was unconscious but 
        still alive. He died, however, of respiratory failure in the minutes that followed. 
        Unfortunately, the storm raged tonight and Sherlock believes that the swell swept 
        the boat causing the body overboard. He had done all of that for the safety  of 
        Mrs. ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓. She was very important to the fisherman.

        That's what we call a crime of passion!
