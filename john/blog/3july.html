        <h3>
         The Jellyfish
        </h3>
        <p>
		This case is an old one. But I think it's a good idea to share it with you. 
		Of all the problems which have been submitted to Sherlock, for solution during the 
		last two years, only two have been presented as tremendous cases: that of Mr. 
		Hatherley's thumb, which I've already related all its aspects, and that of the 
		Murderous Jellyfish. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an 
		acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so 
		dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, 
		even if it gave Sherlock fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by 
		which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more 
		than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less 
		striking when set forth enbloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts 
		slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each 
		new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time 
		the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has 
		hardly served to weaken the effect.        
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Michael Kaiser worked at Sea Life London. Every day he cared for and fed the various 
		aquatic species that inhabit the aquarium. But one day he was found dead over a 
		jellyfish aquarium. Scotland Yard, who had appealed to Sherlock's talent, had come 
		to the conclusion that Mr. Kaiser had died of a respiratory failure caused by an 
		allergy to propylene glycol in his pharmaceutical pomade. Unfortunately, it was not 
		possible. Propylene glycol would never have killed a human being. It was not an accident 
		but a murder.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		However, we could never have known there was a potential assassin lurking close by. 
		An assassin who turned out to be a jellyfish.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Sherlock and I went to the morgue to observe the body. He had on his left forearm 
		a huge burn (probably second degree). The medical examiner told us that the cream 
		he had to apply on his arm is a common treatment for this type of burn. But the 
		problem is that it appears that Mr. Kaiser was allergic to propylene glycol in the 
		cream. This allergy created rashes and uncomfortable sensations in the ENT or 
		respiratory areas.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Afterwards, Scotland Yard suspected he had been poisoned with ricin. This poison 
		causes acute respiratory distress before death and has the advantage of not being 
		easily detectable. But after analysis, no trace of ricin was found in the ointment. 
		Perhaps he had been poisoned otherwise. Sherlock did not agree, unlike me.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		That day, Mr. Kaiser's work at the aquarium involved feeding jellyfishes and exotic 
		fishes. According to his colleagues, they had never noticed that Kaiser had to apply 
		a cream on a second degree burn on one of his arms.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		On the crime scene, we found a chicken sandwich strangely moldy despite its expiry date. 
		Sherlock saw it as an indication of exceptional value. Having analyzed everything down 
		to the smallest details, he wanted to go down from the gateway (gateways above the 
		aquariums to more easily feed the species) and go to see the jellyfishes as a visitor 
		would do. Sherlock and I walked down the corridors, passing by the sharks who stared 
		at us blankly. Then we arrived in front of the jellyfishes aquarium. Unlike other tanks, 
		it was cylindrical and rather narrow. The aquarium did not have many specimens of this species. 
		Sherlock and I watched the jellyfishes and then my friend stopped on a detail: a 
		leaf mingling with the seaweeds looked strangely like green salad. I must say that 
		we had to meticulously analyze the whole tank to see it. This salad leaf blended in 
		very well with the decor. But not enough for Sherlock.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		"What if, contrary to what you all think, the death of Mr. Kaiser only was an accident?" He asked me.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Why? Because of the salad leaf? That's ridiculous! The ointment is a hint more interesting!"
		</p>
		<p>
		"An interesting hint, yes, but that's not an interesting clue." He answered me.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I did not understand what he meant by that. Looking at him questioningly, Sherlock 
		walked to a sign on the wall next to the tank. There was a whole description of the 
		species of jellyfish present in the tank.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		"Tell me, what is the particularity that interests us here in those jellyfishes?"
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I read the information very quickly and came face to face with why Sherlock had 
		asked me to read. These jellyfishes are cubomedusas from Australia, also called 
		"seabird", "sea wasp" or "hand of death" or "hand that kills". That's a lot of 
		nicknames for such a small creature. We could also read:
		</p>
		<p>
		"Its bites are extremely painful and its venom is able to kill a human in a few 
		minutes." In a natural way, Chironex fleckeri does not intentionally kill humans - 
		like all poison jellyfish, this animal has no desire to attacking prey that it could 
		not ingest, and it has been repeatedly shown that it tries to avoid a significant 
		obstacle as soon as it detects it. In cases of stings, it is bathers who have entered 
		involuntarily in contact with it because it is transparent and its tentacles very 
		thin and hardly visible are several meters long."
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Sherlock looked at me as if the evidence had punched me in the face. Which was not 
		the case, I must say. He was disappointed with my reaction.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		"Okay, I see ... you don't understand. You're going to tell me that these jellyfishes 
		couldn't have attacked Kaiser, it's not in their nature. But the facts are there!" Said he.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I retorted that I still did not understand. How could a jellyfish attack him? Why 
		didn't we notice jellyfish stings on the body of the deceased? Of course, Sherlock 
		had the answers to these questions.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		"It's very simple, though, rashes plus a sandwich plus a salad leaf plus deadly 
		jellyfish gives us a killer cnidarian."
		</p>
		<p>
		"What? The jellyfish really has done the hit?" I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
		"It's not a hit, it's more of an accident than a murder. Just try to stop a jellyfish. 
		The fact is that Kaiser was eating his sandwich while feeding the jellyfish. Only, 
		the unfortunate man dropped his meal in the vat, which explains the moldy state of 
		the sandwich. He would have plunged his arm into the vat in order to recover the 
		sandwich. Lack of luck, the jellyfish tentacles had already catched it up. The tank 
		is very narrow for the number of jellyfishes inside.You know the rest of the story: 
		he got stung and he died shortly after having recovered his meal. We didn't see 
		traces of stings on his arm because it was hurt: jellyfish stings, a burn of the 
		second degree on the forearm and rashes due to his allergy, I concede it, but not 
		due to any poison."
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		At his words, the case became quite clear to me. Scotland Yard couldn't do nothing but notice the accident.
