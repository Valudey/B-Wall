        <h3>
         The Wrong Thumb
        </h3>
        <p>
        Mr Hatherley came straight round to Baker Street in a terrible state. He was white 
        as a sheet and bleeding from an awful wound in his hand. Exactly how he came by 
        this wound was at first confusing. It was in the summer of 2014, not long after 
        my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        He explained to us he was an hydraulic engineer, before asking me:
        </p>
        <p>
        "You're a Doctor, right? Perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to 
        the place where my thumb used to be."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves 
        a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy 
        surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        After examining the wound, I said it has been done by a very heavy and sharp instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
        "A thing like a cleaver," said he.
        </p>
        <p>
        "An accident, I presume?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
        "By no means."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Sherlock looked at him with astonished eyes. Was it a sort of murderous attack? Possibly... 
        He sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his 
        keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to 
        the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        "You must know," said Mr Hatherley, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in 
        lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable 
        experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, 
        the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also 
        come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in 
        business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street. I suppose that 
        everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has 
        been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, 
        and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. Every day, from nine in the 
        morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began 
        to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all. Yesterday, 
        however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a 
        man waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name 
        of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, 
        a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I 
        have ever seen so thin a man. His age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        This man offered Hatherley a job at a country house to examine a hydraulic press 
        used, as Stark explains, to compress fuller's earth into bricks, but Stark warned 
        Hatherley to hold his tongue about the lucrative job, which will apparently pay £52.50 per hour. 
        Hatherley felt compelled to take this work, despite his misgivings, as he had had very little work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Upon arriving late at night at the appointed station, Hatherley was met by Stark and 
        driven a considerable distance to the house where he was to render his services. 
        He was still under the spell of the £50 and didn't become afraid even when a woman 
        at the house warned him to flee. He was presently shown the press, and made his 
        recommendations as to needed repairs. Then, he rashly decided to inspect the press 
        a bit more closely, discovering that it was certainly not used for pressing fuller's 
        earth. Hatherley narrowly escaped getting crushed to death when the machine was turned 
        on, and was forced to run for his life, culminating in him getting his thumb severed. 
        Holmes then makes sense of the happenings, recognizing Stark and his allies as counterfeiters, 
        but he, I, and the police arrived too late: the house was on fire, and the perpetrators 
        had fled. Ironically, the press was destroyed when Hatherley's lamp was crushed inside it, 
        setting the machine on fire and ruining the criminals' operation.

           Hey guys! I'll send you an email. Because Sherlock is looking at me with a furious look. Apparently, the life of a woman is at stake. But we should definitely organize something soon, just the three of us.
