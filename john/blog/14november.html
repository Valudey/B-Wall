        <h3>
         The Cardiac Arrest
        </h3>
        <p>
        Joel Fentiman was found strangled in the bedsit he shared with his brother. They 
        had always got on well and there was no sign that this situation had changed since their reunion. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        His brother, David, told us that when he was still a child, his mother died of liver 
        cancer. His father, meanwhile, was execrable. His older brother, Joel, left the family 
        home, leaving him alone despite his distress. He added that after their father's death 
        8 years ago, he spent a whole year in a center to treat his trauma. Shortly after 
        his therapy, he went to live and work in London. He had found a girlfriend and made 
        a modest living. All was well until his brother got back in touch with him and his 
        girlfriend left him the following week. He later asked Joel for help. The latter 
        accepted and lodged David who had been fired from his home following his breakup. 
        Three weeks after his arrival, David woke up next to the corpse of his brother, 
        strangled. Strangulation marks were clearly visible on his neck.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Sherlock has not stopped watching David since he entered. Something was wrong in 
		this story but he did not know what. David handed him pictures of the crime scene 
		and his brother and him a when they were younger, but Sherlock did not look at them 
		once. Except when David opened his mouth to ask a question. At that moment, he began 
		to analyze the crime scene on the picture.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Do you think you'll find something Mr. Holmes? My brother's death must not go unpunished" asked David.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sherlock wasn't answering. I manifested myself by clarifying my voice, which Sherlock 
		took for a request. On this, he replied that he didn't have to worry, that the murderer 
		will be apprehended soon enough. He then asked me to bring Lestrade with a warrant against 
		the "Vatican cameos". I immediately understood what he meant by it, unlike David Fentiman.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sherlock turned back to the man sitting across from him.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Do you have a lawyer?" he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Yes, um ... I think so. Why?"
		</p>
		<p>
		"Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck are your own." Sherlock finished. 
		</p>
		<p>
		On these words, David stood up and ran to the door in order to escape. Unfortunately 
		for him, I was standing in front, a gun in my hand to dissuade him. When Lestrade 
		finally arrived, David confessed his crime, saying that he had acted out of revenge 
		and bitterness.
		</p>
