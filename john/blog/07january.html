        <h3>
         The Lying Detective
        </h3>
        <p>
        I don't want to talk about that. But you all want me to tell you what happened. 
        So yeah... Sherlock's back in my life. He's got himself in a lot of trouble, and I 
        mean it. He made his usual entrance as Mr. Punchline or a drama queen (he really is). 
        Damn it! I could blame him all the day just for that. But to be honest I'm reassured 
        he's still alive. So here's what happened.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        While I was in the middle of a medical appointment, Mrs H. arrived in a red Aston 
        Martin as if she were doing a rally, knocking out a garbage can in the process. 
        She told me that she had come up because of Sherlock. He had apparently become 
        totally uncontrollable. It seemed like Sherlock became inexplicably obsessed with 
        Smith, but his crazy antics as a result from his drug use frightened Mrs. Hudson, 
        who effectively subdued him. She asked me, begged me 
        to examine him. I could not tell him no, unfortunately. I told him that if I was 
        passing through Baker Street one day, I would go see him. Imagine my reaction when 
        she opened the boot of her car. Inside Sherlock was curled up, his wrists handcuffed. 
        He seemed totally unaware of the situation in which he had embarked. Not understanding 
        how Mrs. H. knew where I was, I asked her. She told me that Sherlock had told him where 
        to find me. At the same time my phone rang. Culverton Smith, the man Sherlock had 
        unapologetically accused of being a serial killer, was on the phone, asking if his 
        driver had arrived. To my surprise someone rang the bell. It was his driver. I asked 
        him when Sherlock had given him the address. He replied to me "two weeks ago". 
        It was too much for me. I was very upset at that moment. I entered the room where Sherlock 
        was in and started shouting from all sides to try to understand this situation. 
        Because he had planned everything, since two weeks! Not knowing if he was faking or 
        really drugged, I told him I wanted Molly Hooper's opinion. At the same time, the 
        bell rang again, activated by Molly. He had also planned her visit two weeks earlier. 
        To sum up, much to my shock and annoyance, Mrs. Hudson's arrival with Sherlock , a car sent by 
        Smith, and Molly Hooper with an ambulance, were all prearranged to arrive at my 
        therapist's house at that exact time by Sherlock weeks prior before I had even 
        chosen a new therapist.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Sherlock and I arrived at a studio to meet with Culverton Smith. As Smith took us 
		to visit the new hospital wing for which he was a major donor and thus also named 
		after him, he subtly hinted of being a serial killer to Sherlock and I while meeting 
		with a group of children at the hospital. Smith continued to give us a tour of the 
		hospital by taking us down to his favorite room, the mortuary. Sherlock tried to 
		goad Smith into a confession just as Faith arrived —called by Sherlock via Smith's 
		phone to come—but upon seeing her, realised that the woman that came to his flat 
		was not actually Faith. Mentally unstable from drug abuse and frustrated, Sherlock 
		made a move to attack Smith with a scalpel, but I stopped him and beat up Sherlock 
		out of anger, blaming him.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Sherlock was admitted into Smith's hospital, and Smith visited him, coming in 
		through a secret passageway, apparently. Sherlock stated that he wished for Smith 
		to kill him despite not wanting to die and Smith complied after confessing to his 
		murders. Unknown to him, Sherlock was acting on the orders of Mary who asked him 
		earlier, through a recorded video message given to him posthumously. Knowing what 
		was gonna happen, I rushed to the hospital to save Sherlock. I arrived just in time 
		to pull Smith off from suffocating Sherlock. Believing he could get away with no 
		proof of his confession, Smith was surprised when Sherlock revealed Smith's confession 
		was recorded by a hidden device in my old walking stick which I had left behind earlier.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I can say, I've reconciled with Sherlock. But I'm still upset. It is not an easy task. 
		I mean, being friend with Sherlock. But it is what it is...
		</p>
		<br>
        <p>
        PS : If you want to bother Sherlock (do NOT hesitate), I've recently discovered his birthday was yesterday... Fairly advice
