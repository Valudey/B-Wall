        <h3>
         The Duplicate Man
        </h3>
        <p>
        How could Dennis Parkinson be in two places at the same time? And murdered in one 
        of them? He was discovered stabbed in a private garden in the south of London at 06:34 in 
        the morning. But was declared dead between 11:00 and midnight with no mark or coercion on 
        the body. His key flat was missing. When Lestrade came in Baker Street to propose this case to Sherlock, he 
        was quite embarrassed at first. He thought Sherlock would never solve this case 
        because of the low amount of informations. Even Scotland Yard had abandoned the 
        case.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        One of Dennis Parkinson's friends who does not live far from where the body was 
        found, told us that the night before his death, Dennis, he and his wife ate 
        together in his residence at Casewick Road . He seemed rather worried by family 
        stories. Dennis did not have a family anymore. His parents died in a car accident 
        20 years ago. He had a younger brother, but he died of lung cancer at the age of 32 
        last year. The two brothers have always been very close, according to Dennis' friend. 
        Except during his brother's last days. He had accused Dennis of keeping the 
        majority of the inheritance for himself out of selfishness and of not having helped 
        him pay for his treatment to try to cure him. Apparently Dennis was upset. He felt 
        especially guilty lately.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		His friend told us that he had left his home at 10:50 with two minutes of marge. 
		Only the problem is that 30 minutes before his departure, Dennis Parkinson's Oyster 
		Card was activated at Aldgate Station. The CCTV cameras recorded the comings and 
		goings of each visitor. Sherlock and I could see the recordings of Aldgate Station. 
		To our surprise, we could clearly see Dennis getting into a Circle Line car heading 
		for Hammersmith. Sherlock tried to find back Dennis but could not. "Dennis" never 
		went out of the Tube. So the question was: where did he go out? There were many 
		abandoned stations underground. Only at each station, the metro was never late. 
		In addition, the doors could not open when the train was running. It was 
		inconceivable that he should come out in the middle of a tunnel. Today, this 
		element of the investigation remains a mystery to us.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Subsequently, it turned out that the "Dennis" of the subway was none other than 
		Dennis' twin brother (they were twins!) who had healed and simulated his death in revenge for his 
		brother's egocentricity. He had been hiding for two years on the nose of his brother. 
		He stole his Oyster Card from him and stabbed him in the street. He then returned 
		to his brother's home to recover the spoils of his assassination. Unfortunately, 
		by the time Scotland Yard reacted, he had fled and probably left the country with 
		the rest of the legacy.
		</p>
		<br>
        <p>
        Sherlock always said to me, "it's never twins". Well, damn it Sherlock, I was right!
        </p>
