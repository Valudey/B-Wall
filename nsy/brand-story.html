					<h1>Our Story</h1>
					<p class="white large">New Scotland Yard: a name recognised throughout the world, yet perceived as quintessentially British. It conjures up thoughts of mystery, excitement; strength, justice and determination.</p>
					<p class="large">The name New Scotland Yard is steeped in tradition, it has featured in almost every famous policing story  over the past 180 years.</p>
					<p class="large">In the mid 1990's, police services in England and Wales were given the power to generate income through sponsorship and commercial trading.  The MPS took its first steps into the world of licensing with Corgi Cars who produced a range of police vehicles. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col2">
					<p class="large">Since then interest has grown in police related brands, NYPD being a good example, and crime based television both fictional and documentary continue to attract large audiences.</p>
					<p class="large">Market research was undertaken to learn more about the public perception of "New Scotland Yard" and analysis enabled the brand to be developed.  The new brand gave the MPS  an excellent opportunity to  introduce communities  to the police in a more positive way.</p>
